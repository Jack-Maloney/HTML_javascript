            It can't be seen, can't be felt, can't be heard, and can't be smelt.
            It lies behind stars and under hills, And empty holes it fills.
            It comes first and follows after, Ends life, and kills laughter. What is it?

            It has five wheels, though often think four, You cannot use it without that one more,

            but you can still go shop. What is it?
